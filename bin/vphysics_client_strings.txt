Bad packed vcollide!
Because of the high dimension, the min x-coordinate and max-coordinatepoints are used if the determinant is non-zero.  Option 'Qs' willdo a better, though much slower, job.  Instead of 'Qs', you can changethe points by randomly rotating the input with 'QR0'.
Both Anchors of a Torque_Actuator must be attached to just one object.

If the input is lower dimensional:  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the    correct topology.  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.
If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options thatmay determine an initial simplex:  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than %2.2g.  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.
If you need triangular output:  - use option 'QJ' to joggle the input points and remove precision errors  - or use option 'Ft' instead of 'Q0'.  It triangulates non-simplicial    facets with added points.If you must use 'Q0',try one or more of the following options.  They can not guarantee an output.  - use 'QbB' to scale the input to a cube.  - use 'Po' to produce output and prevent partitioning for flipped facets  - use 'V0' to set min. distance to visible facet as 0 instead of roundoff  - use 'En' to specify a maximum roundoff error less than %2.2g.  - options 'Qf', 'Qbb', and 'QR0' may also help

Precision problems were detected during construction of the convex hull.This occurs because convex hull algorithms assume that calculations areexact, but floating-point arithmetic has roundoff errors.To correct for precision problems, do not use 'Q0'.  By default, Qhullselects 'C-0' or 'Qx' and merges non-convex facets.  With option 'QJ',Qhull joggles the input to prevent precision problems.  See "Imprecisionin Qhull" (qh-impre.htm).If you use 'Q0', the output may includecoplanar ridges, concave ridges, and flipped facets.  In 4-d and higher,Qhull may produce a ridge with four neighbors or two facets with the same vertices.  Qhull reports these events when they occur.  It stops when aconcave ridge, flipped facet, or duplicate facet occurs.

TestRange[
Testing all coplanar points.
The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanarwith a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error forcomputing distances is %2.2g.  The center point, facets and distancesto the center point are as follows:
The halfspace was at index %d
The halfspace was on line %d
The input appears to be in cdd format.  If so, you should use option 'Fd'
The input to qhull appears to be less than %d dimensional, or acomputation has overflowed.Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
These points are the dual of the given halfspaces.  They indicate thatthe intersection is degenerate.
These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, orthey maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial pointsare first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.
This is a Delaunay triangulation and the input is co-circular or co-spherical:  - use 'Qz' to add a point "at infinity" (i.e., above the paraboloid)  - or use 'QJ' to joggle the input and avoid co-circular data
This is the qhull test case.  If any errors or core dumps occur,recompile qhull with 'make new'.  If errors still occur, there isan incompatibility.  You should try a different compiler.  You can alsochange the choices in user.h.  If you discover the source of the problem,please send mail to qhull_bug@geom.umn.edu.Type 'qhull' for a short list of options.
ThreadGetCurrentId
ThreadInterlockedAssignIf64
ThreadSleep
To guarantee simplicial output:  - use option 'QJ' to joggle the input points and remove precision errors  - use option 'Ft' to triangulate the output by adding points  - use exact arithmetic (see "Imprecision in Qhull", qh-impre.htm)

When computing the Delaunay triangulation of coordinates > 1.0,  - use 'Qbb' to scale the last coordinate to [0,m] (max previous coordinate)
When computing the Delaunay triangulation:  - use 'Qz' to add a point at-infinity.  This reduces precision problems.
